          <h1>How do you invest as a family?</h1>
          <p>Investing as a young family - is that possible? Can we afford this without sacrificing our usual standard of living? And if so, what should we invest in? What suits us? And how risky is that?</p>
          <p>Are you a young family with a solid income? This means that you can manage your money in everyday life and still have a little bit left at the end of the month. Sometimes more sometimes less. Would you like to become financially independent step by step? Are you thinking about how you can save and invest money for your children in the long term to give them a financial basis for life?</p>
          <p>Then you face the same questions that my family and I and many of our friends faced. For many years I have been looking for answers and solutions to exactly these questions and challenges. I tried a variety of things and finally found a good and successful path for myself. The good news: It's easier than you think! I would be happy to show you exactly how this works and how you can find your individual path.</p>

        <h1>Who is this Finance Dad</h1>
        <p>I'm Rick. I am a father and have been dealing with the topic of investing for almost 20 years.</p>
        <p>I used to be a banker, but then I got fed up with people in suits, commission hunters and the shackles of the bank as an institution. So I decided to dedicate my time to what I really enjoy: investing, teaching people financial knowledge and advising them on financial matters and, above all, my family.</p>
        <p>I live in normal circumstances in a small rented house, do sports every now and then, love nature and good food.</p>
        <p class="dad-content-p4">In short: I am one of you.</p>
